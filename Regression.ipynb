    "The model employs multiple linear regression to predict the number of touchdowns based on receiving yards and the number of receptions. It assumes a linear relationship between these predictor variables and touchdown counts, allowing it to compute a weighted sum of the inputs for prediction. By fitting the model to historical data, its performance can be evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared, which indicate how accurately the linear relationship captures the underlying trends.\n",

    "The results of the R^2 and MSE show that this model is not a good predictor for how number of receiving yards and receptions predicts number of touchdowns. These results are quite suprising because the number of receptions and yards are usually a great predictor of how many touchdowns a top reciever would get in a game. There are definetly some other variables that were left out that would contribute to the number of touchdowns, but they are definetly not primary and these should do a pretty good job of predicting the number of touchdowns. This model most likely needs a lot more data to be more accurate and would most likely be pretty useful with more data. "
